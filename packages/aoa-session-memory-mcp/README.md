# aoa-session-memory-mcp

`aoa-session-memory-mcp` exposes `.aoa` session evidence and route intelligence
through a small read-only MCP access plane.

It does not replace `.aoa`, raw transcript evidence, generated segment indexes,
atlas maps, search indexes, diagnostics, reviewed distillation, or durable
memory review. It gives agents one repeatable route to ask:

- where a stable operational anchor appeared in sessions;
- which route coordinates match a skill, MCP, hook, tool, path, repo, command,
  failure, decision, writeback pressure, goal, or pattern;
- which evidence refs support a review or debugging pass;
- whether refs and providers look fresh enough to use;
- which route map axis/key should be opened first;
- what compact session brief or retrieval packet should be read before raw
  evidence.

## Source Hierarchy

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `.aoa` raw transcript archive | strongest session evidence |
| `.aoa` segment indexes and manifests | local event maps and technical identity |
| `.aoa` search, atlas, graph sidecar, and diagnostics | route companions and freshness/readiness evidence |
| `aoa-session-memory-mcp` | live read-only access plane over those surfaces |
| `aoa-memo` | durable reviewed memory and writeback review |

Tools:

- `aoa_session_memory_status(include_live)`
- `aoa_session_transport_preflight()`; diagnoses portable stdio child state or
  loopback shared HTTP owner state, distinguishes stale source/config from an
  unavailable owner, rejects non-loopback or malformed HTTP endpoints, requires
  configured and available bearer authentication without exposing its value,
  distinguishes client/CLI environment readiness from owner-side systemd
  credential readiness, and reports the next action when direct calls are not
  current proof.
- `aoa_session_search(query="", filters, limit)`; route-only search is valid when filters such as `route_signal` and `doc_type` are supplied. `layer` is accepted as an input alias for `route_layer`, and explicit `use_shards`/`max_shards` filter controls are honored for bounded fan-out instead of being reported as unsupported filters. MCP returns compact hits, `mcp_route_plan`, and a provider freshness summary by default; follow `full_search_route` for the full archive CLI packet. `date_from`/`date_to` filter indexed search document/session dates; hook receipt timestamp checks should follow the returned `hook_receipts_route`.
- `aoa_session_literal_query_plan(query="", kind="auto", filters)`; plans the cheapest reliable route before broad literal raw-text search. It prefers `entity_usage_chain` for typed operational anchors, entity registry/inventory for broad class queries such as skills/MCP/hooks/tools, rehydrate plus session-scoped search for exact session ids, structured filters for exact route reads, scoped full-text shards when available, and monolith fallback only as a bounded recall safety net. The packet exposes `classifications`, `cost_profile`, `fallback_plan`, and `next_expansion_command` so agents can see why the route was selected and where to expand next.
- `aoa_session_agent_responses(query, session, agent_events, episode, closeout_final, verification_state, failure_state, limit)`
- `aoa_session_agent_closeouts(query, session, episode, limit)`
- `aoa_session_agent_progress_updates(query, session, episode, limit)`
- `aoa_session_agent_reasoning_windows(query, session, episode, limit, before, after)`
- `aoa_session_task_episodes(target, session, episode, status, verification_state, failure_state, limit)`
- `aoa_session_goal_lifecycles(target, session, goal_id, status, event_kind, limit, order)`
- `aoa_session_answer_neighborhood(query, session, agent_events, episode, limit, before, after)`
- `aoa_session_trace(anchor, kind, limit, per_route_limit, session, doc_type)`; the default `doc_type` is `session` for bounded live archive probes, and callers can request `event` when exact event-level evidence is needed.
- `aoa_session_entity_usage_chain(anchor, kind, limit, per_route_limit, consequence_window, document_limit, session, full)`; hot first packet for the distinct lifecycle states observed around a skill/MCP/hook/tool/API/etc entity and any results owned by a structurally matched correlation identity. It preserves the producer-owned lifecycle, claim admission, generation, global/scoped freshness, boundedness, evidence-ref, rejection, and next-route contract while compacting samples. It skips GraphRAG, graph neighborhood, and raw-preview neighborhoods by default. For `kind="skill"`, the compact packet also preserves the producer-owned skill candidate summary and separately bounded rejected foreign-correlation events.
- `aoa_session_entity_dossier(anchor, kind, session, usage_limit, neighborhood_limit, graph_limit, graph_edge_limit)`; heavier human card for a skill/MCP/hook/tool/API/etc entity. It combines generated source identity, usage/consequence audit, before/after neighborhood, graph topology, refs, freshness/noise flags, and explicit next expansion routes without replacing raw or owner-source evidence.
- `aoa_session_entity_usage_audit(anchor, kind, limit, per_route_limit, consequence_window, document_limit, session, full)`; returns compact samples, counts, refs, freshness, and a `full_evidence_route` by default. Set `full=true` only when the caller deliberately needs the full archive evidence packet.
- `aoa_session_entity_usage_neighborhood(anchor, kind, limit, per_route_limit, before, after, raw_preview_chars, document_limit, session, full)`; returns bounded usage windows by default and keeps raw/segment evidence authoritative through refs plus `full_evidence_route`.
- `aoa_session_entity_usage_scenario_audit(sample_size, seed, layers, min_postings, limit, per_route_limit, consequence_window, document_limit, raw_preview_limit, full)`
- `aoa_session_route(axis, key, limit, include_entry_payloads)`
- `aoa_session_brief(session, max_segments)`
- `aoa_session_retrieve(recipe, query, session, limit, event_limit)`; `entity_usage`/`entity-usage-chain` requests are transparently served by the dedicated read-only `aoa_session_entity_usage_chain` route.
- `aoa_session_evidence_packet(intent, query, anchors, refs, limit)`
- `aoa_session_freshness_check(refs, session)`; pass `session` when checking session-relative refs such as `raw:line:412`.
- `aoa_session_pattern_scan(pattern, filters, limit)`
- `aoa_session_entity_inventory(layer, query, session, limit, sample_limit)`; aggregates typed session entities such as `skill`, `mcp`, `hook`, `tool`, `api`, `plugin`, `agent`, `script`, `validator`, `test`, `eval`, `git`, `playbook`, `technique`, `mechanic`, `graph`, and `memory` from route-signal indexes. Entity-registry kind names such as `mcp_service` are normalized to the matching route layer (`mcp`) on input. This is session evidence inventory, not installed runtime inventory.
- `aoa_session_entity_registry(kind, query, lookup, limit)`; reads the generated entity registry snapshot directly for known skills, MCP services/tools, tools, APIs, hooks, scripts, validators, tests, evals, graph, and memory entities. Schema-v2 packets preserve producer-owned content-aware identity candidates, alias/source provenance, collision state, and canonicalization admission. MCP verifies the snapshot schema, the complete declared generation policy and digest, the producer digest against the configured `.aoa` script, and the stored source fingerprint against the snapshot entries. An old, foreign, or internally inconsistent generation remains `stale-readable` navigation and cannot become an admitted identity. Admission is scoped to the persisted snapshot identity; it never proves current repository, installation, registration, or runtime state. This is a fast read-only registry; candidate synthesis, current-owner verification, and `--write` refresh stay outside MCP.
- `aoa_session_live_scenario_audit(seed, profiles, sample_size, recent_days, limit)`; runs a bounded multi-profile live quality loop across entity-registry lookup status, first-route entity dossier, entity usage, hook failures, goal lifecycles, agent closeouts, literal planning, graph neighborhood, graph bridge, and route-rollup query packets. The `entity_registry_lookup` profile checks active/observed/unknown live lookup plus stale/removed previous-snapshot transition probes without mutating the archive.
- `aoa_session_live_scenario_corpus_inventory(full)`; lists source-owned reviewed corpus cases without running them. Use it to choose a case/profile and read `truth_status`; it is route coverage, not live proof.
- `aoa_session_live_scenario_corpus_check(case_limit, full)`; checks the source-owned live scenario regression corpus against current route behavior and keeps warning debts visible as actionable gaps.
- `aoa_session_hook_receipts(event_name, session, date_from, only_errors, limit)`; reads hook receipt evidence directly from `hooks/receipts.jsonl` so hook failures do not depend on noisy search or graph packets. `date_from` filters receipt timestamps (`timestamp`, `received_at`, `generated_at`), not session dates.
- `aoa_session_latest_diagnostics(kind, limit, include_payload)`
- `aoa_session_maintenance_status(deep, include_timers, full)`; returns the canonical read-only `.aoa maintenance-status` packet with `agent_route`, exact next command, search/graph posture, timer snapshot, and MCP stop line.
- `aoa_session_maintenance_plan()`; compatibility entry that returns the same maintenance-status route without timers.
- `aoa_session_route_rollup_query(query, layer="tool", key, route_signal, limit, ref_limit)`; reads the materialized `.aoa` operational route-rollup projection without running maintenance, resampling shards, opening the monolith, using FTS, or hydrating raw body text. Use it when maintenance status says `use_operational_route_rollup_projection`; materialization remains an operator route outside MCP.
- `aoa_session_direct_event_rollup_query(query, usage_role="result", event_type, session_act, layer, key, route_signal, limit, ref_limit)`; reads the materialized direct operational-event rollup without running maintenance, resampling shards, opening the monolith, using FTS, or hydrating raw body text. Use it for compact event-class navigation; behavior proof still expands through `usage-chain` plus raw/segment refs.
- `aoa_session_projection_status(include_payload)`; reads the latest `projection-catchup` diagnostic and returns its `projection_completeness` block plus current maintenance summary. It does not run `projection-catchup`; that writer route stays outside MCP.
- `aoa_session_graph_neighborhood(anchor, kind, depth, limit, edge_limit)`; reads exact or indexed route nodes from the generated SQLite graph under fixed node/edge budgets. An unresolved anchor returns an explicit admission-required owner command instead of running the archive route inside MCP.
- `aoa_session_graph_timeline(anchor, kind, limit)`; reads only direct indexed event edges for the resolved anchor and defers deeper timeline expansion.
- `aoa_session_graph_shortest_path(source, target, kind, max_depth)`; returns the exact owner path command wrapped by canonical `abyss-machine resource launch` admission without faulting broad graph pages inside MCP.
- `aoa_session_graph_bridge(source, target, kind, source_kind, target_kind, max_depth, limit)`; returns the owner bridge command through the same host admission route instead of combining path and timeline expansion as a hidden read.
- `aoa_session_graph_cooccurrence(anchor, kind, limit)`; aggregates a bounded two-hop event-to-route neighborhood without running maintenance or hydrating raw transcript bodies.
- `aoa_session_graphrag_packet(query, anchor, mode, limit, include_semantic_context, rerank_local)`; returns any available bounded graph packet plus the explicit admission-required owner GraphRAG command. Broad lexical/semantic/rerank work never starts as an MCP side effect.
- `aoa_session_explain_graph_packet(intent, anchor, query, limit)`; returns any available bounded graph packet and defers broad explanation expansion to the owner route.
- `aoa_session_graph_eval(limit, include_semantic_context, rerank_local)`; returns an admission-required owner batch command without executing the evaluation inside MCP.
- `aoa_session_graph_quality_audit(limit, sample_ref_limit, anchors, full_graphrag)`; returns an admission-required owner audit command without executing a multi-anchor sweep inside MCP.

Prompts:

- `session-rehydrate`
- `trace-agent-process`
- `debug-operational-anchor`
- `writeback-evidence-check`
- `stale-ref-repair-plan`
- `promotion-candidate-review`

All tools are read-only. They do not reindex, repair, distill, relabel,
export, promote, write memory, accept evidence, or mutate `.aoa`.
Every published tool also advertises the matching MCP safety contract:
`readOnlyHint=true`, `destructiveHint=false`, `idempotentHint=true`, and
`openWorldHint=false`. Codex can therefore distinguish these local evidence
reads from side-effecting calls when it applies MCP approval policy. Package
tests and the stdio/configured-transport validator check the metadata; the
annotations remain hints and do not replace behavior-level smoke tests.

### Evidence-first compact contract

The default `aoa_session_entity_usage_chain` response preserves all
producer-declared lifecycle states separately:
`registered`, `mentioned`, `prompt-visible`, `selected`, `loaded`, `read`,
`procedure-observed`, `invoked`, `completed`, `verified`,
`consequence-producing`, `failed`, and `deflected`. It also preserves
state-specific answer-admission flags, ambiguous identity candidates,
correlation rejections, global and scoped freshness, compact projection
generation identities, budgets, truncation, resolvable evidence refs,
insufficiency, and the exact next route.

Compaction may bound samples and omit non-contract producer detail, but it must
not turn a candidate into a claim, erase a rejected correlation, upgrade scoped
freshness to global freshness, or drop the reason an answer was rejected.
`full=true` remains the explicit source-owned expansion route. MCP transports
this contract and remains weaker than raw events, receipts, and current external
owner/runtime evidence.

### Skill-evidence compact contract

`.aoa` owns skill-evidence classification. The default compact MCP audit,
usage-chain, neighborhood, and dossier packets preserve its
`skill_usage_evidence_v1` candidate summary, complete accepted-state list and
separate `rejection_edge_states`,
`skill_evidence_state`, `usage_actions` / `primary_usage_action`, bounded action
aggregates, and raw/segment/session refs. Foreign tool results with another
correlation id remain in a separate bounded `false_correlation_events` bucket
with `correlation_id`, `source_correlation_id`, and
`rejected_correlation_id`; they are not folded into accepted consequences.

These fields are navigation evidence, not a skill-effectiveness verdict. MCP
keeps `candidate_only`, `invocation_claim_allowed`, and the producer authority
boundary visible, bounds event/action samples, and does not copy arbitrary raw
transcript body fields into the response. `full=true` remains the explicit
archive expansion route when the compact samples are insufficient.

For a producer-classified Codex structured skill input, MCP preserves the
`skill_explicit_selection` entrypoint, the `selected` state,
structured-selection dimensions, bounded composite task-episode refs, and
raw/segment/session refs. Selection does not prove `loaded`. The latter is
admissible only when the producer supplies a distinct runtime load receipt;
neither state proves `read`, procedure observation, invocation, completion,
verification, or consequence. MCP may transport an older producer packet that
contains a legacy `loaded` candidate, but it does not synthesize or promote
that state. Composite task-episode refs retain session identity so equal local
episode ids from different sessions do not collapse; the link remains
candidate evidence and does not permit an invocation claim.

When the producer returns more action buckets than the compact packet can
carry, MCP applies a deterministic semantic priority. Selection/load and
behaviorally meaningful actions are retained before weak mention,
cooccurrence, or context buckets; omission counts remain explicit. This is a
transport ordering rule, not MCP-side reclassification or proof.

`aoa_session_memory_status()` uses a fast search read-model presence probe. It
checks that the portable SQLite search surface, route index, atlas, and latest
diagnostic pointers are available, but it does not run global search freshness.
Use `aoa_session_freshness_check(...)` or an explicit `.aoa search-provider-status`
operator command when freshness itself is the question.

When a direct Codex tool call fails with `Transport closed`, first run the CLI
fallback:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=mcp/services/aoa-session-memory-mcp/src python -m aoa_session_memory_mcp.cli transport-preflight
```

If it reports `direct_tool_transport_status=restart_required`, first follow its
`configured_transport_check_route`. For stdio, the package validator can prove
a freshly started source server while direct calls still need a fresh
Codex/MCP process. For shared HTTP, source/deployed parity and a fresh owner
process must be restored before direct calls count as current evidence.

Entity inventory packets include a compact `provider` summary from
`search-provider-status --provider portable_sqlite`, so agents can see whether
the atlas/search read model is current before trusting skill/MCP/hook/tool/API
inventory counts.
Wide inventory packets are bounded route packets, not full atlas dumps. They
return compact sample refs, a `route_packet`, `response_profile`, omitted
sample counts when the request exceeds the MCP sample budget, and a
`next_expansion` / `next_expansion_command` pointing to the explicit route or
search expansion that can load heavier entry payloads.

Scoped agent-event routes such as `aoa_session_agent_responses`,
`aoa_session_agent_closeouts`, `aoa_session_agent_progress_updates`,
`aoa_session_agent_reasoning_windows`, and
`aoa_session_answer_neighborhood` use the portable SQLite projection as a fast
MCP read path when the live schema supports it. These packets expose
`cost_profile`, `search_projection`, `quality`, and evidence refs, remain
bounded and read-only, and may return zero results for a session without
classified agent events instead of starting a slow archive scan. `quality`
reports agent-event counts, freshness buckets, source/read-model counts,
conversation-act counts, raw/segment ref coverage, and the latest returned
event so MCP callers can judge whether the fast packet is sufficient or should
be expanded through raw refs. Text-query fallbacks and
`next_expansion_command` use the `.aoa` shard-aware archive route
(`--use-shards --max-shards 24`) when raw before/after windows or richer
consequence analysis are needed.
Exact `kind="agent_event"` usage audits reuse that indexed read path and treat
the returned rows as event-class occurrences, not causal entity-use claims.
If deeper consequence analysis is needed, or the bounded projection is
unavailable, MCP returns the owner audit command through `abyss-machine
resource launch` instead of starting a broad search subprocess.

`aoa_session_entity_usage_neighborhood` has the same shape for lightweight
probes: when `raw_preview_chars=0` with small limits, or when the deep archive
route times out, MCP returns a search-backed route-signal packet with refs and
a `next_expansion_command`. That keeps live agent audits bounded while leaving
raw transcript evidence authoritative. These lightweight packets are marked as
search-only probes: they do not claim that local consequence evidence is absent
unless the archive route has loaded the actual neighborhood window. Route-only
searches without text stay on the current archive search read model instead of
shard fanout so refs and freshness do not drift behind the monolith.

`aoa_session_maintenance_status()` and
`aoa-session-memory://maintenance/status` are the agent decision packet for
freshness and maintenance posture. They delegate to `.aoa maintenance-status`,
remain read-only, and tell the caller whether to use graph/search, wait for
live catch-up, run operator maintenance outside MCP, or escalate to raw/deep
checks. When `.aoa` provides an `operations` summary, MCP preserves warnings,
latest search-index timings, recent problem jobs, last successful
auto-maintenance profiles, `why_maintenance_long` evidence, and compact
search-shard raw-text fallback dependency signals. It also keeps the latest
search-shard materialization timings and bounded `slow_sessions` samples so an
agent can see which session made maintenance slow before choosing an expansion
route. The compact status packet keeps scoped full-text shard expansion
commands visible while leaving shard materialization and maintenance outside
MCP.

`aoa_session_projection_status()` and
`aoa-session-memory://projection/status` are the read-only orientation route for
post-classifier/schema catch-up. They read the latest `projection-catchup`
diagnostic, surface the compact `projection_completeness` rows, and include the
current maintenance summary. If that diagnostic is missing or stale, MCP returns
the operator command to run outside MCP instead of starting catch-up itself.

`aoa_session_graph_neighborhood(...)` first tries the generated
`graph/graph.sqlite3` store for exact route nodes such as
`route:mcp:mcp:aoa_session_memory_mcp`. That fast path follows indexed
source/target edges, compacts nodes/edges/evidence refs, reports truncation and
omitted counts, and keeps the archive `graph-neighborhood` command as
`next_expansion_command`. If the exact node or graph store is unavailable, MCP
returns a deferred packet and leaves that command outside MCP for owner-aware
resource admission. Timeline and cooccurrence use bounded indexed reads.
Shortest-path, bridge, GraphRAG, explanation, evaluation, and quality-audit
remain explicit owner routes and are never hidden behind an ordinary MCP read.
Their `next_expansion_command` uses `abyss-machine resource launch` with a
stable session-memory demand key, owner-declared foreground activity, and no
static memory cap. The host therefore admits and learns the new process through
its existing transient-unit path; MCP remains a read-only planner and does not
become another resident scheduler.
Deployment must provide the `abyss-machine resource launch --activity`
capability before activating this MCP route; packets expose that requirement in
`mcp_access.owner_admission.required_host_capability`.
Every packet remains route evidence, not reviewed truth.

When `.aoa` is actively catching up to open Codex transcripts,
`aoa_session_freshness_check(...)` may report
`current_with_deferred_live_updates` and the provider may report
`ready_with_deferred_live_updates`. That means the last committed search/graph
snapshot is usable for routing, while the named live sessions are visible but
not asserted as fully indexed. If exact newest transcript evidence matters,
open the returned raw/session refs or run the explicit maintenance/audit route
outside MCP.

`aoa_session_memory_status(include_live=true)` additionally runs a fast
full-archive readiness gate without extracting readiness evidence samples. Full
sample-bearing `route-readiness --write-report` remains an explicit operator or
audit route outside the MCP status path.

When installed as a package, the direct server entry point is
`aoa-session-memory-mcp-server`; `aoa-session-memory-mcp` remains the CLI entry
point.

Both entrypoints accept `--workspace-root`, `--aoa-root`, and `--script-path`.
Without explicit arguments or matching environment variables, discovery checks
the current directory and its parents for a marker-valid standalone root, then
for `workspace/.aoa`. It has no hidden host-specific fallback and fails with the
required markers and next action when no valid root is available.

## Standalone Package Projection

`abyss-stack` remains the only authored implementation owner. The installable
package committed in `aoa-session-memory/packages/aoa-session-memory-mcp/` is a
deterministic one-way projection governed by `ABYSS-STACK-D-0084`, not a second
editing lane. Its manifest carries the owner commit, package and export schema
identity, file digests, entrypoints, compatibility ranges, root-discovery and
authority contracts, and the complete MCP surface catalog.

The owner-side route, allowlist, schema, drift behavior, and standalone
validator are documented in [`projection/README.md`](projection/README.md).
Export does not install, deploy, register, or restart the system MCP runtime.

Codex discovers MCP tools when it attaches to the configured owner. The server
auto-reloads the `core.py` implementation for existing tools when the source
file changes, so packet logic and provider/freshness fixes do not require a
manual restart. Changes to the tool list, tool schemas, server wrapper, or
import path still require restarting the configured owner and, when the client
registry changed, the Codex client before using live output as proof.
Source-local CLI smokes prove the code path. The package validator proves a
fresh stdio process; `systemctl --user status
aoa-mcp-http@aoa-session-memory.service` is the owner check for configured
shared HTTP. A shared HTTP Codex entry must set
`bearer_token_env_var = "AOA_MCP_HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN"`, and the corresponding
credential must be present in the Codex process environment. The preflight
reports URL validity, bearer configuration, execution context, environment and
systemd-credential readiness, source conflicts, and transport-specific process
freshness without returning either bearer value. In a client/CLI context only
the environment credential proves client smoke readiness; inside the shared
owner, either its environment credential or its systemd credential may prove
owner startup readiness. It does not treat the absence of a per-Codex child as
failure when a fresh, authenticated loopback owner is configured.

## Agent Route

Executable run, smoke, and validation commands live in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md#run). This README describes the service surface;
`AGENTS.md` owns the operational route for agents.
