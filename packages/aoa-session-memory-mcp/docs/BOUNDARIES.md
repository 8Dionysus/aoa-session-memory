# Boundaries

## Authority Split

| Context | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.aoa` | raw sessions, manifests, segment indexes, route-signal classifier, search index, atlas maps, diagnostics, retrieval packets | MCP packaging |
| generated `.aoa` companions | deterministic route/search/readiness read models | reviewed truth stronger than raw evidence |
| `aoa-session-memory-mcp` | read-only access, compact route/evidence packets, freshness checks, prompts, CLI, service-local validation | archive mutation, reindexing, repair, distillation, naming, promotion, writeback, durable memory |
| `abyss-stack` | runnable MCP package and local transport topology | `.aoa` archive meaning or session evidence authority |
| `aoa-memo` | durable reviewed memory and writeback review | raw session archive truth |

## Interface

`aoa-session-memory-mcp` calls fixed `.aoa` read commands and reads fixed
generated JSON surfaces under the configured `.aoa` root.

It returns compact JSON objects with route candidates, session refs, segment
refs, raw refs, route signals, freshness status, diagnostics summaries, and
explicit authority boundaries. Typed skill packets may also carry
producer-owned candidate states, action summaries, and accepted-versus-rejected
correlation discriminators; MCP transports those fields but does not promote
them into invocation, effectiveness, or proof verdicts.
Usage-chain packets also transport producer-owned lifecycle, state-specific
answer admission, compact generation identities, separate global/scoped
freshness, budgets, truncation, evidence refs, and insufficiency. Bounding a
sample must not erase a rejected correlation or convert `selected` into
`loaded`, `invoked`, `verified`, or `consequence-producing`.
Entity-registry packets transport producer-owned identity candidates,
source/alias provenance, collision preservation, and canonicalization
admission. MCP may verify schema, generation-policy and producer digests, and
the snapshot's internal source fingerprint, but it must not synthesize a
candidate, choose between colliding definitions, promote an incompatible
snapshot beyond `stale-readable` navigation, or turn a compatible persisted
identity into a current repository/installation/registration/runtime claim.

Route hits are candidate evidence. Search results, atlas entries, diagnostics,
and MCP responses are not reviewed truth.

## Stop Lines

- No archive write tools.
- No `index-maintenance --apply`.
- No reindex, relabel, repair, distillation, naming, export, install, hook, or
  promotion commands.
- No durable memory writeback.
- No proof verdict computation.
- No entity canonicalization or collision resolution.
- No raw transcript bulk exposure by default.
- No treating MCP output as stronger than `.aoa` raw refs or reviewed owner
  sources.
- No remote, wildcard-bind, gateway, or proxy exposure; optional shared HTTP
  remains authenticated and loopback-only under `ABYSS-STACK-D-0077`.
