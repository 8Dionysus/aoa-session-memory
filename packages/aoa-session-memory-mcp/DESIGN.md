# AoA Session Memory MCP Design

## Thesis

`.aoa` should be callable by OS Abyss agents as the session evidence and route
intelligence layer without copying raw archives, generated maps, or diagnostics
into every prompt.

The stable form is:

```text
anchor/query/intent -> aoa_session_memory MCP -> route candidates -> evidence refs -> freshness/readiness -> next action
```

MCP is the access layer. It is intentionally weaker than `.aoa` raw transcript
evidence, segment indexes, generated atlas maps, search provider state, and
reviewed distillation.

## Contexts

`.aoa` owns raw session evidence, compaction boundaries, segment indexes,
route-signal classification, search indexes, atlas maps, diagnostics,
rehydration, retrieval packets, graph sidecars, naming, distillation, and
promotion queues.

`aoa-session-memory-mcp` owns just-in-time read-only access, compact route
packets, freshness checks, route prompts, and MCP service packaging.

`abyss-stack` owns the runnable MCP service package and local transport
topology: portable stdio by default and the optional authenticated loopback
shared HTTP owner defined by `ABYSS-STACK-D-0077`.

`aoa-memo` owns durable reviewed memory and writeback review. This MCP may
prepare evidence refs for that route, but it does not write memory.

## Operation

An agent should be able to start from a stable operational anchor:

```text
aoa_session_trace(anchor, kind="auto", doc_type="session")
aoa_session_literal_query_plan(query, kind="auto", filters={...})
aoa_session_entity_usage_chain(anchor, kind="auto")
aoa_session_search(query, filters)
aoa_session_route(axis, key)
aoa_session_graph_neighborhood(anchor, edge_limit=...)
aoa_session_graph_bridge(source, target, source_kind="mcp", target_kind="tool")
aoa_session_route_rollup_query(query, layer="tool")
aoa_session_direct_event_rollup_query(usage_role="result")
aoa_session_live_scenario_corpus_inventory()
```

The anchor may be a skill, MCP, hook, tool, path, repo, command, config,
failure mode, decision thread, writeback concern, goal, or recurring pattern.
The service treats all of these as route coordinates, not as privileged object
types.

The generated entity registry is a hot navigation read model. MCP reads
`maps/entity-registry.json` directly for skill/MCP/hook/tool/API/etc lookup and
inventory. Refreshing or rebuilding that registry remains an explicit `.aoa`
operator route outside MCP, because source-surface scans can be materially
slower than an agent health probe.
Inventory packets also carry a compact portable SQLite provider summary. This
keeps entity counts tied to search/atlas freshness without making MCP run
maintenance or promote the generated atlas to archive truth.

Session-level tracing is the default live probe because `.aoa` archives can be
large. Event-level tracing remains available through an explicit
`doc_type="event"` request when exact event evidence is needed.

Literal-query planning is a read-only route selector. It should run before a
broad raw-text query when the caller is unsure whether the text is a skill,
MCP, hook, tool, path, command, error, goal, or plain phrase. The planner does
not prove evidence; it explains whether to start with typed usage-chain,
typed registry/inventory for broad entity-class questions, structured search
filters, scoped full-text shards, or monolith fallback. Class questions with
use/error/consequence intent include a bounded entity-usage scenario route
before broad raw-text recall.

Skill evidence remains producer-owned. When `.aoa` returns a typed skill
candidate summary, the MCP compact adapter preserves the complete accepted
state vocabulary, separate rejection-edge vocabulary, candidate/claim
boundary, event-level state and action semantics,
correlation ids, and evidence refs. Results rejected because they belong to a
different tool correlation stay in a separate bounded rejection bucket rather
than becoming accepted consequences. This transport contract does not let MCP
decide whether a skill was effective, invoked, verified, or complete, and it
does not widen compact packets to arbitrary raw transcript body fields.

Structured Codex skill input is transported as an explicit selection
candidate. Its `loaded` action means the skill payload was embedded in the
structured input envelope; it is distinct from `skill_read`, procedure
observation, completion, and effectiveness. Bounded task-episode links use
composite session-plus-episode refs so repeated local episode ids cannot merge
across sessions. They remain candidate-only correlation metadata. When action
buckets exceed the packet limit, a deterministic semantic priority keeps
selection/load and stronger behavioral signals ahead of weak context or
cooccurrence buckets while preserving omission counts; MCP still does not
reclassify producer evidence or compute a verdict.

Agent-event, exact agent-event usage-audit, and lightweight
usage-neighborhood routes have MCP-local fast paths over the portable SQLite
projection. They are deliberately bounded:
session-scoped answer/closeout/progress/reasoning packets can return zero
classified events without failing, and lightweight entity-neighborhood probes
can return route-signal refs without raw previews. The packet names the deeper
`.aoa` command for raw windows or consequence expansion. Agent-event text
queries and expansion commands use shard-aware archive routes when available,
while queryless scoped packets may stay on the MCP-local SQLite shortcut and
report their cost/profile explicitly. The MCP does not run expansion if it
would turn an agent health probe into a bulk scan.

Session review and continuation use compact packets:

```text
aoa_session_brief(session)
aoa_session_retrieve(recipe, query, session)
aoa_session_evidence_packet(intent, query, anchors, refs)
aoa_session_graphrag_packet(query, anchor)
```

Graph neighborhood, timeline, and cooccurrence are bounded evidence-packet
builders. They read the generated `graph/graph.sqlite3` store through indexed
node and edge lookups with fixed budgets.

Shortest-path, bridge, GraphRAG, graph explanation, evaluation, and quality
audit can fault broad graph pages or expand lexical, semantic, rerank, and
multi-anchor work. MCP returns a canonical `abyss-machine resource launch`
command that wraps the exact owner command, declares the request foreground,
and lets the host admission plane learn its demand; MCP never runs that work as
a hidden read side effect. Unresolved indexed anchors follow the same rule.
Activate these expansion routes only after the host provides `abyss-machine
resource launch --activity`; the host capability must land before the MCP
route that emits it.
Packets report truncation, omitted counts, freshness, and admission-required
owner expansion while raw/segment/session refs remain stronger than the
generated graph.

Freshness and readiness stay explicit:

```text
aoa_session_memory_status(include_live=false)
aoa_session_freshness_check(refs)
aoa_session_latest_diagnostics(kind)
aoa_session_maintenance_status(deep=false, include_timers=true, full=false)
aoa-session-memory://maintenance/status
aoa_session_maintenance_plan()
aoa_session_projection_status(include_payload=false)
aoa-session-memory://projection/status
```

The maintenance status is read-only. It is the canonical `.aoa
maintenance-status` packet with an `agent_route`, exact next operator command,
search/graph/timer posture, and any `.aoa` operations summary such as
warnings, latest search-index timings, recent problem jobs, last successful
auto-maintenance profiles, and `why_maintenance_long`. It can name operator
commands that would refresh `.aoa`, but the MCP does not run them.
`aoa_session_maintenance_plan` is retained as a compatibility entry to the same
status route.

Projection catch-up is intentionally split. MCP may read the latest
`projection-catchup` diagnostic and expose its `projection_completeness` rows,
but MCP does not run `projection-catchup`, because even a plan path participates
in the maintenance coordinator. The write route remains an explicit operator
command outside MCP.

The status path is intentionally cheap. By default it uses a fast presence probe
over the fixed portable SQLite search read model and does not run global
freshness. That makes status suitable as the first agent health/orientation
call. Freshness remains explicit through `aoa_session_freshness_check(...)` or
the `.aoa search-provider-status` operator route.

Freshness distinguishes stable stale work from live transcript catch-up. If an
open or recently written Codex transcript under `.codex/sessions` has not yet
been fully archived into search/atlas/graph projections, MCP reports
`current_with_deferred_live_updates` / `ready_with_deferred_live_updates`
instead of hiding the dirty sessions or failing the whole route. Agents may use
the last committed snapshot for navigation, but must treat deferred live
sessions as not fully checked and go to raw refs or operator maintenance when
the newest transcript lines matter.

When `include_live=true`, MCP runs a full-archive readiness health gate without
evidence sample extraction. The latest saved route-readiness diagnostic remains
the cached audit summary, and sample-bearing readiness stays an explicit `.aoa`
operator command rather than a frequent MCP health check.

## Source Discovery

The service has no universal host-path default. It follows the portable
discovery contract carried in `src/aoa_session_memory_mcp/contract.py`:

1. explicit CLI roots;
2. explicit environment roots;
3. a marker-valid standalone repository found from the current directory;
4. a marker-valid `workspace/.aoa` found from the current directory;
5. an actionable failure.

Marker validation checks the archive CLI, search-provider config identity, and
session-manifest schema identity. Conflicting explicit roots fail closed and
symlinks resolve before validation. Stack-owned launch profiles continue to
pass their explicit workspace/archive/script roots.

The deterministic owner-side export route and downstream provenance manifest
are defined in `projection/README.md` under `ABYSS-STACK-D-0084`. Export does
not activate the runtime or turn the projection into an independent owner.

## Readiness

The first layer is ready when:

- status reports portable search provider state and atlas readiness;
- trace/search return route candidates with evidence refs;
- route maps can be read by axis/key;
- graph neighborhoods, timelines, paths, cooccurrences, and GraphRAG packets
  return evidence refs without becoming authority;
- graph neighborhoods stay compact by default and expose `edge_limit`,
  `truncated`, and omitted counts so agents can expand deliberately;
- session briefs are compact and avoid bulk raw transcript output;
- retrieval and evidence packets preserve raw/segment/session refs;
- compact skill packets preserve producer-owned candidate states, action
  semantics, accepted-versus-rejected correlations, and claim limits without
  carrying raw transcript bodies or computing a verdict;
- freshness checks do not claim more than they can prove;
- prompts route agents through evidence before writeback or promotion;
- every tool publishes closed-world read-only, non-destructive, idempotent MCP
  annotations so approval clients do not have to infer side effects from prose;
- validation proves the service did not become a writer, maintainer, reindexer,
  distiller, or archive authority.
